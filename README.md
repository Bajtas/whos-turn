# Whos turn?
Every time you are playing board game, you and your friends talks with each other.
Sometimes someone forgot to make a move(make some action is theirs turn).

That's why they are asking "Who's turn?".
What happens if no one know who's turn is right know?

This can lead your game into one of following problem:
- somebody got a second turn - that player got advantage
- somebody lost his/her turn - this person probably will lost the game

If you don't care about it because "it's just a game" it's fine, but maybe somebody from your friends care about that because he/she likes board games. That's why this application was made. :)

Have a good day!
