# Whos turn?
Every time when you are playing board game, you and your friends are talk to each other.
Sometimes someone forgets to make a move or doesn't remember whose turn is right now.

That's why they ask "Who's turn is it?".
What happens if no one knows who's turn is right know?

This can lead your game into one of the following problem:
- somebody gets a second turn - that player gets advantage
- somebody loses his/her turn - this person probably will lose the game

If you don't care about it because "it's just a game" it's fine, but may somebody from your friends cares about that because he/she likes board games. That's why this application was made. :)

Have a good day!
